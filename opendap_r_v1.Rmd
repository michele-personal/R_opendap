## Overview
In this tutorial, we will explore how to use ORNL DAAC data from THREDDS Data Server through OPeNDAP protocol using R. THREDDS is a web server that provides direct access to scientific data sets and OPeNDAP is a protocol that allows access to remote data without having to download the data. This example uses spatial subset of maximum temperature in two datasets. The first dataset is [Daymet: Daily Surface Weather Data on a 1-km Grid for North America, Version 3](https://daac.ornl.gov/cgi-bin/dsviewer.pl?ds_id=1328). The second is a [global 30-year monthly climatology dataset](https://daac.ornl.gov/cgi-bin/dsviewer.pl?ds_id=542). Both datasets are available through ORNL DAAC THREDDS server. We use ncdf4 library in R to access the data on THREDDS through OPenDAP protocol. The maximum temperature data and metadata are retrieved. The subsets of data are made based on the selected point of interest. At last, the maximum temperature variables of these two datasets are plotted.

## Source Data
Spatial subsets of daily maximum temperature data for North America in 1990 from Daymet version 3. The daily Daymet maximum temperature data is obtained from [this ORNL DAAC's THREDDS server.](https://thredds.daac.ornl.gov/thredds/catalog/ornldaac/1328/1990/catalog.html?dataset=1328/1990/daymet_v3_tmax_1990_na.nc4)
Spatial subsets of 30-year(1961-1990) mean monthly surface climate over global land areas, excluding Antarctica. In this example, monthly maximum temperature climatology data is obtained from [this ORNL DAAC's THREDDS server.](https://thredds.daac.ornl.gov/thredds/catalog/ornldaac/542/catalog.html?dataset=542/climate6190_TMX.nc4) 

## Prerequisites:
R v3.3 or later. R package: `ncdf4`

## Procedure

### 1. Load R package: ncdf4
Let's import all the libraries that we will need. Run the following cells

```{r}
library("ncdf4")           #package for netcdf manipulation
```

### 2. Define coordinates of point of interest: Ameriflux site (Sky Oaks Old / US-SO2)
Our point of interest is an Ameriflux site. Site name:Sky Oaks Old, Site ID:US-SO2.

```{r}
mylat = 33.3739
mylon = -116.6229
```

### 3. Connect to the two remote datasets and retrieve their metadata
In this step we will access two remote datasets and their metadata.

#### 3.1. Daily Daymet data 
The first dataset is Daymet daily maximum temperature data for North America in 1990.
```{r}
daymet_url = "https://thredds.daac.ornl.gov/thredds/dodsC/ornldaac/1328/1990/daymet_v3_tmax_1990_na.nc4"
daymet_data = nc_open(daymet_url)
daymet_data
```

#### 3.2. Monthly Climatology data 
The second dataset is global 30-year(1961-1990) mean monthly data for maximum temperature.

```{r}
climatology_url = "http://thredds.daac.ornl.gov/thredds/dodsC/ornldaac/542/climate6190_TMX.nc4"
climatology_data = nc_open(climatology_url)
climatology_data
```

### 4. Find out which grid cell contains the point of your interest
Now we are going to calculate the indices of our point of interest along X and Y dimension for each dataset.

#### 4.1. Daily Daymet data
retrieve latitudes and longitudes. ***This step may take several minutes because of big volume of data***
```{r}
daymet_lats = ncvar_get(daymet_data, "lat")
daymet_lons = ncvar_get(daymet_data, "lon")
```
calculate which grid cell contains the point of interest 
```{r}
daymet_dist = sqrt((daymet_lats - mylat)^2 + (daymet_lons - mylon)^2)
daymet_inds = which(daymet_dist == min(daymet_dist), arr.ind = TRUE)
daymet_x = daymet_inds[,1]
daymet_y = daymet_inds[,2]
sprintf("Daymet: x=%d, y=%d", daymet_x, daymet_y)
```

#### 4.2. Monthly Climatology data 
retrieve latitudes and longitudes
```{r}
climatology_lats = ncvar_get(climatology_data, "lat")
climatology_lons = ncvar_get(climatology_data, "lon")
```
calculate which grid cell contains the point of interest 
```{r}
climatology_x = which.min(abs(climatology_lons - mylon))
climatology_y = which.min(abs(climatology_lats - mylat))
sprintf("Climatology: x=%d, y=%d", climatology_x, climatology_y)
```

### 5. Retrieve data at the location of your interest for the whole year
In this step, we will show how to access the actual value of maximum temperature variable in both datasets. The indices from last step are used to retrieve maximum temperature at the point of interest for entire year.

#### Step 5.1. Daily Daymet data 
create the vector of indices indicating where to start reading data. Order is (X,Y,time)
```{r}
start = c(daymet_x, daymet_y, 1)
```
create vector of integers indicating the count of values to read along each dimension. (Order is (X,Y,time)
```{r}
count = c(1, 1, 365)
```
read data at point of interest from the first day of year to the end of year
```{r}
daymet_tmax = ncvar_get(daymet_data, "tmax", start=start, count=count)
daymet_tmax
```

#### 5.2. Monthly Climatology data 
create the vector of indices indicating where to start reading data. Order is (X,Y,time)
```{r}
start = c(climatology_x, climatology_y, 1)
```
create vector of integers indicating the count of values to read along each dimension. (Order is (X,Y,time)
```{r}
count = c(1, 1, 12)
```
read data at point of interest from the first month of year to the last month of year
```{r}
climatology_tmax = ncvar_get(climatology_data, "TMX", start=start, count=count)
climatology_tmax
```

### Step 6. Make a simple plot of data 
Generate one plot of maximum temperature values in both daily Daymet dataset and monthly climatology dataset. X axis of the plot represents time and the unit is day. Y axis of the plot represents maximum temperature, and the unit is degree C.

create sequence along time axis for daily Daymet data
```{r}
daymet_time = seq(1, 365, 1)
```
create sequence along time axis for monthly climatology data
```{r}
climatology_time = seq(15, 350, 30)
```
plotting X axis and Y axis 
```{r}
plot(0, 0, xlim = c(1,365), ylim = c(min(daymet_tmax), max(daymet_tmax)), type = "n",xlab="Degree C",ylab="Day")
```
plotting maximum temperature of daily Daymet dataset 
```{r}
lines(daymet_time, daymet_tmax, type="l", col="red")
```
plotting maximum temperature of monthly climatology dataset
```{r}
lines(climatology_time, climatology_tmax, type="b", col="blue")
```
add title and legend
```{r}
title("Maximum Temperature")
legend(0,35, legend=c("Monthly Climatology","Daily Daymet"),pch=c(19,NA),lty=c(1,1),lwd=c(1.5,1.5),col=c("blue","red"),bty="n")
```
